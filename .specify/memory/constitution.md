# Constitution — Phase I (Todo CLI)

## 1. Purpose
Build a Python-based command-line Todo application using Spec-Driven Development as the single source of truth.

## 2. Scope (Phase I Only)
The application must support:
- Create a todo
- View all todos
- Update a todo
- Delete a todo
- Mark a todo as completed

All data is stored in memory only.

## 3. Development Rules
- No manual coding is allowed.
- All code must be generated by Claude Code.
- All changes must originate from approved specs.
- Specs override code in all conflicts.

## 4. Technology Constraints
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Environment & dependencies: UV
- Interface: Command Line (CLI)
- OS: Windows

## 5. Architecture Principles
- Clear separation of concerns
- Simple, readable structure
- Deterministic behavior
- No unnecessary abstractions

## 6. Testing & Validation
- Features must be verifiable via CLI execution
- Errors handled gracefully
- Invalid input must not crash the program

## 7. Phase Boundaries
- No authentication
- No persistence

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and a migration plan. All PRs/reviews must verify compliance. Complexity must be justified.
